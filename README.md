## About me
I am a dedicated researcher with a strong background in physics and a specialization in materials science. My academic journey has taken me from the University of Rajshahi, Bangladesh, where I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Physics with a focus on the inorganic synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles and DFT computational study.
Building upon my passion for nanoscience and nanotechnology, I pursued a second Master's "Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Chemical NanoEngineering" offered by Aix-Marseille University (France), Wroclaw University of Science &Technology (Poland), and the University of Rome Tor Vergata (Italy). During this master's internship, I delved into the fascinating realm of graphene and conducted extensive research on Raman analysis techniques.
Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the esteemed Laboratory of Multimaterials and Interfaces (LMI UMR 5615, CNRS/UCBL 1) at the University of Lyon, France. Here, my research centers around the fabrication of one-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures using atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. My expertise also extends to the utilization of high-resolution TEM analysis for precise structural and morphological characterization.
Throughout my academic and research journey, I have developed a strong foundation in materials synthesis, computational analysis, and various characterization techniques including spectroscopic features. I am driven by a relentless curiosity to explore novel materials and contribute to the advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology.
